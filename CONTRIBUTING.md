## How to contribute to Spring Warehouse

### Did you find a bug

* Please open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability in Spring Warehouse.

* Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub
  under [Issues](https://github.com/averageflow/spring-warehouse/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the
  problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/averageflow/spring-warehouse/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title
  and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test
  case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

* If you have ideas of things that could be added or improved in the project you are also welcome to make an issue.

## Did you write a patch that fixes a bug

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

## Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability
of Spring Warehouse will generally be accepted.

## Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one

* Suggest your change as an issue on GitHub and perhaps start writing code to support the idea.

## Do you want to contribute to the Spring Warehouse documentation

* Any effort on the documentation front whether more or less technical oriented, is always welcome.

Spring Warehouse is a volunteer effort that was born with the goal to learn more Java and Spring Boot. We encourage you
to pitch in and join the project!

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
